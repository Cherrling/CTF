(sigh)
(Subtitles appear behind the scenes)
Hey, Vergil, your portal-opening days are over.
(Stops, turns left and extends left hand)
Give me the Yamoto.
If you want it, then you'll have to take it.
(Stands up, holding the Yamato, walks around the white plastic chairs of the food stall from the left, and faces Dante)
(Playful smile)
But you already knew that.
I had a feeling you'd say that.
(Raises right hand, summons Dante's sword)
(* Drumbeat of unknown meaning *)
How many times have we fought?
(* Drumbeat of unknown meaning *)
(Puts Dante's sword on his shoulder)
Hard to say.
It's the only memory I have of us since we were kids. 
(* Drumbeat of unknown meaning *)
Time to finish this, Virgil.
(* Drumbeat of unknown meaning *) 
Once and for all!!
(Pick up the Yamato and use his thumb to raise the knife)
(Playful smile)

Immortal temptation takes over my mind
Condemned
Falling weak on my knees, summon the strength Of mayhem
I am the storm that is approaching
Provoking black clouds in isolation
I am reclaimer of my name
Born in flames, I have been blessed
My family crest is a demon of death!
Forsakened, I am awakened
A phoenix's ash in dark divine
Descending misery
Destiny chasing time
Inherit the nightmare, surrounded by fate
Can't run away
Keep walking the line, between the light
Led astray
Through vacant halls I won't surrender
The truth revealed in eyes of ember
We fight through fire and ice forever
Two souls, once lost, and now they remember
I am the storm that is approaching
Provoking black clouds in isolation
I am reclaimer of my name
Born in flames, I have been blessed
My family crest is a demon of death!
Forsakened, I am awakened
A phoenix's ash in dark divine
Descending misery
Destiny chasing time
Disappear into the night
Lost shadows left behind
Obsession's pulling me
Fading, I've come to take what's mine!
Lurking in the shadows under veil of night
Constellations of blood pirouette,
dancing through the graves of those who stand at my feet
Dreams of the black throne I keep on repeat
A derelict of dark, summoned from the ashes
The puppet master congregates all the masses
Pulling strings, twisting minds as blades hit
You want this power? Then come try and take it
Beyond the tree
Fire burns
Secret love
Bloodline yearns
Dark minds embrace
Crimson joy
Does your dim heart
Heal or destroy?
Bury the light deep within!
Cast aside, there's no coming home!
We're burning chaos in the wind!
Drifting in the ocean all alone!
