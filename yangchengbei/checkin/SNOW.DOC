SNOW(1)                                                   SNOW(1)


NAME
       snow - whitespace steganography program

SYNOPSIS
       snow [ -CQS ] [ -p passwd ] [ -l line-len ] [ -f file | -m
       message ] [ infile [ outfile ]]

DESCRIPTION
       snow is a program for concealing messages in text files by
       appending  tabs  and  spaces  on the end of lines, and for
       extracting messages from files containing hidden messages.
       Tabs  and spaces are invisible to most text viewers, hence
       the steganographic nature of this encoding scheme.

       The data is  concealed  in  the  text  file  by  appending
       sequences  of up to 7 spaces, interspersed with tabs. This
       usually allows 3 bits to be stored  every  8  columns.  An
       alternative  encoding scheme, using alternating spaces and
       tabs to represent zeroes and ones, was  rejected  because,
       although it used fewer bytes, it required more columns per
       bit (4.5 vs 2.67).

       The start of the data is  indicated  by  an  appended  tab
       character,  which  allows  the  insertion of mail and news
       headers without corrupting the data.

       snow  provides  rudimentary  compression,  using   Huffman
       tables optimised for English text. However, if the data is
       not text, or if there is a lot of data,  the  use  of  the
       built-in compression is not recommended, since an external
       compression program such as compress or  gzip  will  do  a
       much better job.

       Encryption  is  also  provided,  using  the ICE encryption
       algorithm in 1-bit cipher-feedback (CFB) mode. Because  of
       ICE's  arbitrary  key  size, passwords of any length up to
       1170 characters are supported (since only 7 bits  of  each
       character  are used, keys up to 1024-bytes are supported).

       If a message string or message file are specified  on  the
       command-line,  snow will attempt to conceal the message in
       the file infile if specified, or standard input otherwise.
       The  resulting  file  will be written to outfile if speci-
       fied, or standard output if not.

       If no message string is provided, snow attempts to extract
       a  message  from  the input file. The result is written to
       the output file or standard output.

OPTIONS
       -C     Compress the data if concealing, or  uncompress  it
              if extracting.

       -Q     Quiet   mode.  If  not  set,  the  program  reports
              statistics  such  as  compression  percentages  and
              amount of available storage space used.

       -S     Report on the approximate amount of space available
              for hidden message in the text file. Line length is
              taken  into account, but other options are ignored.

       -p password
              If this is set, the data  will  be  encrypted  with
              this password during concealment, or decrypted dur-
              ing extraction.

       -l line-len
              When appending whitespace, snow will always produce
              lines shorter than this value. By default it is set
              to 80.

       -f message-file
              The contents of this file will be concealed in  the
              input text file.

       -m message-string
              The  contents  of  this string will be concealed in
              the input text file.  Note that, unless  a  newline
              is  somehow  included in the string, a newline will
              not be printed when the message is extracted.

EXAMPLES
       The following command  will  conceal  the  message  "I  am
       lying" in the file infile, with compression, and encrypted
       with the password "hello world". The resulting  text  will
       be stored in outfile.

              snow  -C  -m  "I  am lying" -p "hello world" infile
              outfile

       To extract the message, the command would be

              snow -C -p "hello world" outfile

       Note that the resulting message will not be terminated  by
       a newline.

       To  prevent line wrap if text with concealed whitespace is
       likely to be indented by mail  or  news  readers,  a  line
       length of 72 or less can be used.

              snow -C -l 72 -m "I am lying" infile outfile

       The  approximate  storage capacity of a file can be deter-
       mined with the -S option.

              snow -S -l 72 infile
